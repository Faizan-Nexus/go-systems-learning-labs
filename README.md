# Go Projects

This repository contains a structured collection of Go programs focused on learning the language and understanding how Go is used to build concurrent and networked systems.

The repository is organized as learning labs: small, focused implementations designed to build a strong mental model of Go’s syntax, standard library, concurrency model, and I/O patterns.

What this repository covers

Go language fundamentals and idiomatic code structure

Error handling, interfaces, and package organization

Concurrency using goroutines and channels

Basic networking using Go’s standard library

Clear, minimal examples focused on understanding behavior rather than performance

The goal of this repository is to build solid systems-level foundations in Go by implementing concepts directly instead of only reading about them.

All code here is learning-oriented, not production software. The emphasis is on:

Correctness

Clarity

Understanding how things work under the hood
