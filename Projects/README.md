# Go Projects

This folder contains larger, more integrated Go programs that apply the concepts explored in the learning labs.

Unlike the learning labs, which focus on isolated concepts, the projects here are intended to combine multiple ideas—such as concurrency, synchronization, I/O, and program structure—into cohesive, end-to-end programs.

## What this folder contains

Projects in this folder are designed to:

Use Go’s concurrency model in realistic scenarios

Combine multiple components (e.g., workers, pipelines, networking, coordination)

Handle cancellation, timeouts, and graceful shutdown

Demonstrate clean program structure and separation of concerns

Go beyond single-file or single-concept examples

Each project is self-contained and focuses on solving a specific, well-defined problem.
