#Go Learning Labs

This folder contains focused, topic-driven exercises for learning Go in a systematic way.

Each subfolder isolates a specific area of the language or ecosystem and contains small programs written to explore behavior, constraints, and common patterns.

What this covers

Core language features and idioms

Concurrency primitives and coordination patterns

Basic networking and I/O

How Go programs are structured in practice

Why this matters

Go is often used in infrastructure, backend services, and distributed systems.
These labs focus on building the mental models required to work in those environments confidently and correctly.
